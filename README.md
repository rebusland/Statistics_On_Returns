Analysis, visualization and statistical inference on price returns from selected securities,
such as the SP500 index and the Tesla stock, is carried out.
Input data in the selected time span are automatically retrieved from Yahoo finance through pandas_datareader.
The following plotting, numerical and statistical libraries have been exploited: Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, SciPy.
A quick outline of the project (comments on the Jupyter notebook are quite neat):
 - Daily returns: analysis and statistics.
 - Distributions (Gaussian, t-Student...).
 - Analysis of the fat tails.
 - Quantile-Quantile plots, CDF.
 - Hypothesis testing on distributions.
 - Statistical tests on the distributions: Kolmogorov-Smirnov, Jacques-Brera, Shapiro-Wilk.
